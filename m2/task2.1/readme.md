# What are the most popular hypervisors for infrastructure virtualization?
The most popular hypervisors are: VMWare, KVM, Hyper-V, VirtualBox,  v-Sphere, Azure Virtual Machines, Oracle VM, ESXi
# Main differences of the most popular hypervisors
Hyper-V is cheaper decision compared to VMWare, but VMWare has fault tolerance system, systems of host systems' resources balancing. Also there is available free KVM virtuaization system. It is integrated inside of Linux kernel so it treats hardware rosources directly. Things that I can attribute to disadvantages are: absence of support system and less stability when KVM works with big projects.
